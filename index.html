      <p>I am a brain-tumor, brain-hemmorage, and stroke survivor. Before brain damage and the successive loss of motor skills, I competed against others in sports. Now, I compete against the me of yesterday, utilizing faith and the support of others to push through doubt and obstacles. </p>

      <p>I am a proud husband and father of three. My life doesn't begin or end with me, and it is my privelege to invest my resources into seeing their flourishing. As others, specifically my wife, support me in any endeavor that I pursue, it is my desire to support others and help them thrive.</p>

      <p>Related to that, I am currently the director of an inner-city youth center. In this role I am able to offer support and mentorship to disadvantaged youth and help create opportunities through things like turoring and teaching coding.</p>
