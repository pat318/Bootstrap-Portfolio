        <p>A native of Pasadena, CA and a resident of Southern California for most of my life, I am happy to now call Sacramento, CA. my home. Sacramento is the "Goldilocks" city: not to big, and not too small, but just right. My wife and I love being outdoors, and Sacramento offers great weather and great proximity to worldclass activites, whether in the snow or at the beach. One attractive thing about this town is the fact that it is a family friendly city, which holds great appeal because of the fact that my wife and I have three young children, from 7 down to 1. Keeping up with our kids is activity enough!</p>

        <p>I graduated with a B.A. in Economics from San Diego State University in 2003. Upon graduating from school I worked in commercial real estate for two years and have also done some work in residential real estate selling homes.</p>

          <p>At the age of twenty I had brain surgery to remove a tumor, and in the process I lost the use of the right side of my body. I pursued the remainder of my undergrad studies without the ability to take notes! At times in my recovery I felt completely alone and depressed, and I had to work hard to achieve things that once came easy to me. I learned two valuable things from this time: the importance of community and the support of loved ones like my wife, and anything worth getting is worth working hard for.</p>
